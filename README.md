Geo-location refers to the identification of the geographic location of a user  or computing device via a variety of data collection mechanisms.  
Geo Pin-point uses your browser's HTML5 Geo-location feature along with the Google Maps API in order to accurately pin point the users location anywhere in the world.
This is a project that can be used to plot multiple points on the maps which is currently not supported by Google Maps.
